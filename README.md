# Backend Ticket Booking System 

This project provides a complete, fully functional backend implementation of a ticket booking system based on a microservice architecture. I built it primarily to improve my knowledge in this area and because I actually enjoy working on such systems recently. The services are organized in a monorepo as this is a private, non-production project, but the system is nonetheless fully operational. Full documentation is available at: www.blabla.com
